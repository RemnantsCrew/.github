# THE FUNKIN' REMNANTS CREW

This is the GitHub page for The Funkin' Remnants Crew!

If for some reason you don't know what Funkin' Remnants actually is, we started out as a gimmick account on Twitter that's mostly dedicated to archiving old content for [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/funkin)!

Our Profile Picture features a wireframe version of Boyfriend which was initially used as the Funkin' Developers Profile Picture before it was changed to the one we see today.

Now we're developing a fully fledged remix mod for Funkin' which features many unused elements that have been covered on Funkin' Remnants Socials before, as well as a pretty nice wireframe style.

Here at the Funkin' Remnants Crew, we are indeed Funkin' our Remnants. Look forward to cool stuff from us in the future!
